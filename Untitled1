<h3 class= "main">
Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine 
players each who take turns batting and fielding.
</h3>
<div> The batting team attempts to score runs by  hitting a ball 
(that is being thrown by the opposing team's pitcher) with a bat 
swung by the batter, and then run counter clockwise around the bases:
frirst, second, third, and home. A run is scored when a player advances
arouind the bases and touches home plate. Players on the batting team 
take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which
tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in severalk ways. A player
on the batting team who reaches a base safeely can later attempt to
advance to subsequent bases during teammates' turns batting, such as 
a hit or by other means. The teams switch between batting and fielding
whenever the fielding team records three outs.
</div>

<h5>
One turn batting for both teams, beginning with the visiting team records three outs, constitutes an inning.A game is composed of nine innings, and the tema with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. If the score is tied at the end of nine innings, extra inningsare usually played. Baseball has no game clock, although most games end in the ninth inning.
