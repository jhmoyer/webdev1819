                <h3>School</h3>
                <p><img src="./images/Lane.jpg" class="normal">I am currently a junior at Lane Tech College Prep. Each year at Lane Tech, I have taken Honors Chinese. I think that my Chinese class is very enjoyable; and because we learn a lot, it can be very challenging at times. This year, I am taking AP Physics and Ap US Government; and from what I have heard, both of the classes are challenging and require lots of studying to succeed. I am going to try my hardest to pass both of these AP exams, and recieve college credits. This year is a very important year for me. I am taking the ACT and the SAT, while I am also looking into colleges that I want to apply to. </p>

                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I am sixteen years old, and I live with my mom, dad, and younger sister, who is 15 years old. When I am at home, and I am not studying, I enjoy playing Fortnite with my friends. I also have set the goal to have a cool sports car when I am older, so that is one this i can work up to in the future. Throughout the summer, I am almost on a golf course everyday, whether I am caddying or playing.<i>(These three of my interests are listed above.
